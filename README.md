Data-Analyze3-Investigate-a-dataset

Project Overview

In this project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it by using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make analysis easier.


Libraries:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

What have learned in this project:
    Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
    Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
    Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format I can use
    Have experience communicating the results of my analysis
    Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code
    Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let I access data more conveniently
    Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings
